# HeyMax Subcaps Viewer (Archived)

This project has served its purpose. The HeyMax.ai app now fills the gap that this project was originally built to solve, so this repository is archived and no longer maintained.

## Why This Exists (and Why It Still Matters)

This was the first project where I truly used AI to build something end-to-end. Through it, I learned how to use AI to code better, think more clearly about my objectives, and move faster without sacrificing quality. It has strong sentimental value for me as a milestone in my journey.

Since starting this project, the AI landscape has changed dramatically. The way we should use AI back then may not necessarily hold true today, so treat the approaches and learnings here as a snapshot of that time.

## AI Usage in This Repository

This repo also documents how I worked with AI during development. The `.github` directory captures a multi-role workflow (product manager, staff engineer, code reviewer, and QA) plus Copilot Workspace instructions that outline how to collaborate with AI responsibly and systematically. See the files in `.github/` for the recorded approach to using AI as a structured partner in the build process.

The original README has been preserved in [README.archive.md](README.archive.md).
